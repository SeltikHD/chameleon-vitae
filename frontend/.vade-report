## Vercel Web Analytics Installation for Nuxt

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Chameleon Vitae Nuxt application.

### Changes Made:

**1. Package Installation:**
- Installed `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` using Bun package manager
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `bun.lock` to reflect the installed package and its dependencies

**2. App Configuration (app/app.vue):**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/nuxt'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component to the template, placed inside `<UApp>` alongside the existing `<NuxtLayout>` component
- Preserved all existing code structure, including head configuration, SEO metadata, and template structure

### Implementation Details:

The Analytics component was strategically placed within the `<UApp>` component to ensure it's present on all pages while maintaining the existing layout structure. The import uses the Nuxt-specific entry point (`@vercel/analytics/nuxt`) for optimal integration with the Nuxt framework.

### Verification:

- ✅ Build completed successfully (no errors)
- ✅ Linter passed with no issues
- ✅ Type checking completed without errors
- ✅ All lock files updated correctly
- ✅ Existing code structure preserved

The implementation follows Nuxt and Vue best practices, with the Analytics component added as a self-closing tag in the template alongside other root-level components.
